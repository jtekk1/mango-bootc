## Installation

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:

  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/jtekk1/mango-bootc:latest
  ```

- Reboot to complete the rebase:

  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:

  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/jtekk1/mango-bootc:latest
  ```

- Reboot again to complete the installation

  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

## ISO

If build on Fedora Atomic, you can generate an offline ISO with the instructions available [here](https://blue-build.org/how-to/generate-iso/#_top). These ISOs cannot unfortunately be distributed on GitHub for free due to large sizes, so for public projects something else has to be used for hosting.

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/blue-build/template
```
